# My Tools

> This repo has a bunch of scripts I wrote that actually help me in my life!

#  (^ - ^)/

> **he-to-en.py:** When you click the change keyboard button and start typing in a different language it can be frusturating, use this script to battle this.

> **vitc-price.py:** Uses the ViteX web API to print the price of VITC.

# Python

> Yes, I know this is Python, JS is too hard.
